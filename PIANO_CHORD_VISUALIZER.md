# Piano Chord Visualizer (PCV) Implementation Plan

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED (December 2024)

## Overview
The Piano Chord Visualizer will replace the current ExploreTabView content with an interactive chord exploration tool that allows users to:
- Select a key (C, D, E, F, G, A, B - white keys only initially)
- Display all seven diatonic triads for the selected major key (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°)
- See chord tones highlighted on a scrollable piano keyboard
- Visualize root (blue), third (green), and fifth (orange) with distinct colors
- Show chord function names (Tonic, Supertonic, Mediant, Subdominant, Dominant, Submediant, Leading Tone)

**Note**: See [DIATONIC_TRIADS_FEASIBILITY.md](./DIATONIC_TRIADS_FEASIBILITY.md) for detailed analysis of the diatonic triad implementation approach.

## Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components to Reuse:
1. **ScrollablePianoView** - Already has:
   - Multi-octave scrollable piano
   - Key highlighting system with color states
   - Audio playback integration
   - Performance optimizations (caching)

2. **ScrollablePianoKeyView** - Provides:
   - Individual key rendering
   - Highlight states (none, scale, chord, root, playing)
   - Touch interaction and audio playback
   - Color theming system

3. **KeyScaleSelector** (partially) - We can adapt:
   - The key selection UI pattern (pill buttons)
   - State management pattern
   - DataManager integration

4. **TheoryEngine** - Already provides:
   - Chord generation capabilities
   - Key management
   - Music theory calculations
   - Tonic integration

5. **AudioEngine** - Handles:
   - Note playback
   - Chord playback

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core PCV Components (4-5 hours)

#### 1.1 Create ChordVisualizerView (Main Container)
```
Features/Explore/Views/ChordVisualizerView.swift
```
- Replace ExploreTabView content
- Container for all PCV components
- State management for selected key and chord type
- Layout with key selector, chord type grid, and piano

#### 1.2 Create KeySelector Component
```
Features/Explore/Components/KeySelector.swift
```
- Horizontal scrollable pill buttons for white keys only (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
- Similar to KeyScaleSelector but simplified
- Updates TheoryEngine with selected key
- Highlight current selection

#### 1.3 Create DiatonicChordGrid Component
```
Features/Explore/Components/DiatonicChordGrid.swift
```
- 2x4 grid displaying all seven diatonic triads for the selected key
- Each chord button shows:
  - Chord symbol (e.g., "C", "Dm", "Em")
  - Roman numeral (e.g., "I", "ii", "iii")
  - Scale degree name (e.g., "Tonic", "Supertonic")
- Visual selection state with highlighting
- Automatically updates when key changes using `Key.primaryTriads`

#### 1.4 Adapt ScrollablePianoView for Chord Display
```
Features/Explore/Components/ChordPianoView.swift
```
- Extend ScrollablePianoView to highlight chord tones
- Modify KeyHighlightState enum to include:
  - `.chordRoot` (blue)
  - `.chordThird` (green)
  - `.chordFifth` (orange)
- Update color mapping logic

### Phase 2: Chord Logic Integration (3-4 hours)

#### 2.1 Create ChordVisualizerEngine
```
Features/Explore/Services/ChordVisualizerEngine.swift
```
- Specialized service for chord visualization
- Methods:
  - `getDiatonicTriads(for key: String) -> [Chord]` - Uses `Key.primaryTriads`
  - `getChordToneRoles(chord: Chord) -> [NoteClass: ChordToneRole]`
  - `getScaleDegreeName(for index: Int) -> String` - Returns "Tonic", "Supertonic", etc.
  - `getRomanNumeral(for chord: Chord, in key: Key) -> String`
- ChordToneRole enum: `.root`, `.third`, `.fifth`
- ScaleDegree enum with cases for all seven degrees

#### 2.2 Update TheoryEngine Integration
- Add method: `getChordForVisualization(root: String, type: ChordType) -> Chord?`
- Ensure proper Tonic chord construction
- Handle enharmonic spelling based on key context

#### 2.3 Create Chord Display Logic
- Map chord.noteClasses to piano key highlights
- Determine which octaves to highlight (middle octave by default)
- Handle enharmonic equivalents (C# vs Db)

### Phase 3: UI Polish and Interactions (2-3 hours)

#### 3.1 Visual Enhancements
- Add chord symbol display with Roman numerals (e.g., "C Major (I)", "D Minor (ii)")
- Show scale degree name below chord (e.g., "Tonic", "Supertonic")
- Display chord formula (1-3-5) with actual notes (e.g., "C-E-G")
- Add color legend at bottom (Root = Blue, Third = Green, Fifth = Orange)
- Smooth animations for chord changes
- Group chords by function (Tonic: I, vi | Subdominant: IV, ii | Dominant: V, vii°)

#### 3.2 Piano Interaction Enhancements
- Auto-scroll to show chord tones when selection changes
- Highlight feedback when tapping chord tones
- Play full chord when selecting chord type
- Play individual notes when tapping keys

#### 3.3 State Persistence
- Save last selected key and chord type
- Integrate with DataManager
- Restore state on app launch

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Tonic Integration Points
- Use `Key.primaryTriads` to get all diatonic triads for a key
- Leverage `chord.noteClasses` for getting chord tones
- Use `chord.romanNumeralNotation(in: Key)` for Roman numeral display
- Tonic automatically handles proper chord qualities (major, minor, diminished) for each scale degree

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Cache chord calculations per key
- Minimize piano re-renders using computed properties
- Use `@State` for local UI state, TheoryEngine for shared state

### 3. Enharmonic Handling
- For initial implementation, use sharp notation for all black keys
- Future enhancement: context-aware enharmonics based on key

### 4. Audio Integration
- Play chord on selection change
- Individual note playback on key tap
- Use existing AudioEngine methods

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. ChordVisualizerEngine tests:
   - Chord generation accuracy
   - Chord tone role assignment
   - Available chord types

2. UI Component tests:
   - Key selection state
   - Chord type selection
   - Piano highlighting logic

### Integration Tests
1. Key + Chord selection flow
2. Audio playback verification
3. State persistence

## Migration Path

1. Keep existing ExploreTabView temporarily
2. Create new ChordVisualizerView alongside
3. Add feature flag to switch between old/new
4. Once stable, replace ExploreTabView content
5. Remove old implementation

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Extended Chord Types**
   - 7th chords (maj7, min7, dom7, halfDim7)
   - Extended chords (9, 11, 13)
   - Altered chords

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Chord inversions
   - Voice leading visualization
   - Chord progression builder
   - MIDI export

3. **Educational Features**
   - Chord construction explanation
   - Interval visualization
   - Scale relationship display

## Success Criteria

1. Users can select any white key (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) as the tonic
2. All seven diatonic triads display correctly for the selected key
3. Each chord shows its symbol, Roman numeral, and scale degree name
4. Piano highlights show root (blue), third (green), fifth (orange) 
5. Audio playback works for full chords and individual notes
6. State persists between sessions
7. Performance remains smooth with no lag
8. Chords update automatically when changing keys

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1: 4-5 hours
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours  
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- **Total: 11-14 hours**

This implementation plan provides a solid foundation for the Piano Chord Visualizer while leveraging existing components and maintaining the app's architecture principles.
